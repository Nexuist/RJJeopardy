### Introduction
This is an app I created for my English class in my freshmen year of high school (2013-14) with a friend. I've uploaded it for legacy purposes. The basic premise is a simple jeopardy game with fill in the blank, true/false, and multiple choice questions, centered around Romeo & Juliet lore. The game can also handle scorekeeping for two teams.
